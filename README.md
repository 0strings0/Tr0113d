# Trolled - DLL Injector Exploit


Trolled is a powerful  DLL injector exploit designed to allow privilege escalation. It is meant to be used for windows 10/11. This project is meant as a bypass for school laptops and other locked devices given out by organizations. This exploit should not be used for any malicious or illegal means.

## How It Works

Trolled exploits a common vulnerability in certain systems that allows unauthorized escalation of privileges by tricking the system into running fake system dlls in a mock folder. Which the dll will then open a prompt.
